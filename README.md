# Overview
The objective of this project is to build a web application for tracking competitor details for a set of industry sectors. The users of the app can be stakeholders of the pertaining industries, entrepreneurs, VCs, or any other individuals who want information on some industry or company, or technology/products and/or the any other details concerned to the covered industries within the app. The app will basically have two types of users--Buyers and Contributors. As the name suggests, buyers can login through subscription and search/sort/filter throughout the app for the selected item. On the other hand, contributors can publish through the app by adding items like a new company profile, or a data/information of a company or an industry. Monitoring competitors can provide business/organizations with powerful insights. The idea of building the app came from the market need for organizers to track of the industry to stay ahead in the competition.

# Features

# Technologies
• Java • Spring Boot • MySQL • Hibernate • Thymeleaf templates • SonarQube • APIs • DevOPs • AWS

# What I'll Have to Learn
I will learn to cteate the complete infrastructure in AWS environment to host the application. I will learn to integrate tools like SonarQube for code quality check.I may also learn to include different APIs if I find them useful for my app. I will also learn DevOps for build and deployment automation.
